# Advent of Code 2022 - code reposiory ❄️

This repository was made to keep track of the code made to solve https://adventofcode.com/2022 .

It is an Advent calendar of small programing puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels.

I could use any programing language to solves this task, so i decided to use TypeScript.
